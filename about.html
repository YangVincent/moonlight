<p>
I've spent 4 years trying out different careers while working at my tech job full-time. <br><br>
It's led me through working in VC in Thailand, introducing African startups to european impact investors, working as the Chief Product Officer for <a href="https://www.joblio.com">joblio.com</a>, being a podcast host at the <a href="https://www.newbooksnetwork.com">New Books Network</a>. <br><br>
Now, I'm helping others experiment with learning about niche, fulfilling careers. I'm still trying to see if this might be profitable down the line, but the theory is that there are difficult jobs to try, like therapy, where it's hard to test out the career for yourself. I think some therapists out there would be willing to give you a tour / give you a mock trial to see if you'd enjoy being a therapist. If this sounds interesting to you, please send me some information about yourself <a href="./index.html">here.</a>
